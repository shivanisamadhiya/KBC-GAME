I Created a KBC-Style Quiz Game Using Python! 🎯🎯🎯

Excited to share one of my recent projects — a fully functional "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (KBC)-style quiz game built using Python!

This game was inspired by the popular Indian television show and includes features such as:

Interactive Questions with multiple choice answers

Lifelines (like 50:50, Audience Poll, and Skip Question)

Level-based Progression with increasing difficulty

Score tracking and visual feedback

Clean and user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter

Modular code structure for easy expansion and maintenance

Technologies & Libraries Used:

Python (Core Logic)

Tkinter (GUI Framework)

Random & Time (for interactivity and logic)

JSON (for question storage)

This project helped me strengthen my Python fundamentals and practice OOP, GUI design, and basic game mechanics. It was also a fun way to simulate real-world applications of programming in entertainment and education.
